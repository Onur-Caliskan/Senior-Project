From Data to Cluster: Enhancing Second-Hand Car Valuation with Descriptions


Second-hand car sites have recently
been frequently preferred by people who want to buy
a car. This study aims to investigate the effect of the
description texts of each advertisement on second-
hand vehicle sites on the prices in the relevant adver-
tisements and to cluster the cars according to their
quality by blending the ready-made features in the
advertisements with the features extracted from the
text.
